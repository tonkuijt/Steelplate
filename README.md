# Steelplate
Project to build software for the hardware needed to make a steelplate rack for speedshooting.

# Primary objective

Make a steel plate rack consisting of 5 target and 5 target lights. Create a WiFi-access point that gives access to a web page where you can set the type of drill to practice, starts and stops drills, and displays the results of the drills. The objectives may change while developing

# Secondary objective

Publish the hardware side of things, based on the Atmel ATMEGA328P. Might come with the Arduino loader on it, but also might not. Arduino still uses resources that may be needed for other things.
